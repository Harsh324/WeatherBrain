GUI to analyize the climate change patterns

## Roadmap

- [x] 1). Analysis of Temperature change.  
- [x] 2). Temperature changes over a city , over a state , over a country , over a continent  , over Earth  
- [x] 3). Rainfall Pattern affected due to temperature changes , using precipitation data.  
- [x] 4). Create Module for TemperatureAnalysis.
- [x] 5). Create GUI for TemperatureAnalysis.
  - [ ] 1). Add GUI support for different screen sizes.
  - [ ] 2). Reduce Code(functions).
  - [ ] 3). Integration of OOPs.
- [ ] 6). Concentration of greenhouse gasses over period of time ex Co2 , So2 , N2O etc .  
- [x] 7). Smoothing the data so that a clear trend is visible.  
- [ ] 8). Inference as per trends in our data.
